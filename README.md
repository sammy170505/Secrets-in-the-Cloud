# Secrets in the Cloud
Project to demonstrate the detection, prevention, and deception of attackers in credential abuse within public cloud environments.

## Overview: 
 A secret (API key, token, etc.) is accidentally exposed in a misconfigured cloud resource. The goal is to demonstrate the full attack lifecycle and implement **detection**, **prevention**, and **deception** defenses against credential abuse in public cloud environments.

According to the **Tenable Cloud Security Risk Report 2025**:

> *“54% of organizations using AWS ECS task definitions have at least one secret embedded.”*  
> *“3.5% of AWS EC2 instances store secrets in their user data — a high-risk attack surface.”*  
> *“Secrets can be leaked via public storage, misconfigured metadata, and CI/CD pipelines.”*
